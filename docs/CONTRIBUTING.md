## Rules
* Obey the rules for each project
* Contact the project lead before making any changes to a particular project
* The contact for the project lead would be in the README file for each project
* Most projects would use a Gitflow workflow, make sure you are familiar with that before contributing. [Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)
